Flevance
===============================================================================

This repository es created to store all the information about my configuration
on linux systems. I'll upload all the *dot-files* and *configuration-files* that
I think that is relevant to me in the future.

Why this name?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I did want to create a repo with a name that will funny to remember and it
should be something with the '*dot*' word but I can't find anything. After that
fail I decide to use a sentence of one of the characters in One Pice anime, Law.
Finally, I decide to use the name of the city where he born.
